* Tired of using a bloated framework? Create your own.
* Yeah, yeah so I used code from other people too in a few places.
* Common page components done in a minimal and accessible fashion ready for further styling.
* Variables in the LESS files should allow for quick customisation.

## What's included

* Well thought-through HTML/CSS (I hope) using a BEM methodolgy.
* Content toggle.
* Modal.
* Tabbed panels.
* Horizontal or vertical "navbar" - including a skip navigation button.
* A common master page layout I find myself creating.
* A flyout panel (from the left or right).
* Forms and form controls.
* A method to build different colored themes from the base files (a bit niche).
* Not ideal, but there's Emmet code in the Less files to build the component's HTML.


## What's not included

* A lot, like grid and typography systems and breakpoints...
* Feature detecting with Modernizr (so remember to add your custom script).
* Attractiveness, black, greys, red and blue! Settings, baby!
